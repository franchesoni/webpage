## Why to share?

The idea is that internet provides us with the scale (millions can get to see you) and opportunity to passively provide useful or exciting information to others. Another viewpoint is that if, as Einstein thought, the meaning of life is about contributing back, then all the things that we know or study or do are useless until they reach other people. In this sense, sharing should be, by definition, the final episode of every productive thing you do.

## What to share?

As a general rule, the problems that you find not solved, or questions that you don't find answered easily, can be something to write and put out there. More importantly, every journey you take is potentially filled with challenges that provide insights that can be very valuable for those coming after you in the same journey.

## What is in there for me?

Writing is also good for clarifying thoughts, understanding more deeply each idea and just letting things out. As someone (Feynmann?) said, you don't know the topic until you're able to explain it to someone.

## What is the cost?

When you have done something new that is worth sharing, presenting it can take some time. However, with practice and care during the process of solving or studying or building, the cost of sharing can be greatly reduced.
