# Research Ideas

Research ideas are similar to business ideas. You can make business that give you money but don't really add value to the world (e.g. tobacco companies). Similarly, you can write papers that give you cites but don't really add value to the world (e.g. papers that state things that are wrong or discard some interesting ideas). Of course, it is very easy to say that both money and cites are correlated with added value, but that is not always the case.

Research ideas are also similar to business ideas because they must be viable. There are business ideas that are not achievable, and research ideas that are also too long of a shoot. We would like low-hanging fruits instead of very tortuous paths. 
Another similarity (sometimes) is that you can copy other people (e.g. business ideas or research contributions) and apply them over different areas (e.g. countries, problems). They are also similar in the sense of having some business or research projects that know their future plans pretty well, and others are entering a new, unknown market or scientific question. 

I feel compelled to find differences between business and research. And maybe from an abstract level they are very similar. Indeed, there are research companies around. The main difference between our traditional view of business and research is probably the amount of innovation happening. Research should be innovation by definition, while businesses struggle to continue innovating. 

In any case, I am interested in the idea of non-epsilon research (much more than incremental). I don't know if it exists, but without any doubt, there are works that show more of a breakthrough than others.

# List of ideas

- This problem is one I found when I recommended connected-papers to a collaborator. He told me it was a great tool, and I agree. The question is, what happens if the people create their paper with their cites and they are given the graph of connected papers? That could be nice, but what if people consequently cited all the papers in the graph? Would that collapse to clusters, to a everyone-cite-everyone regime, or what? I think this is a mathematics research question
